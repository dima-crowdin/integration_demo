# Set thresholds for elements

You can set thresholds to put in context the data used to calculate KPI and indicators in dashboard elements. Thresholds can be defined only for the element types **Number** and **Gauge**. The set thresholds will be marked with colours in the element graphics, so that you can see at a glance where your results are positioned as compared to defined limits.

Number and gauge type elements have predefined thresholds automatically applied when using a default dashboard, and any time the element is newly added to a dashboard.

These thresholds have been defined following generally accepted good practices and may not be indicative for certain industry or company specifics.

Colours are used to display graphically the threshold limits: red for the interval of unsatisfactory performance, yellow for the interval of average performance and green for the interval of high performance.

1.  Place the cursor over the element you want to change thresholds for, and a menu of icons will appear in the top right corner of the element.
2.  Click on the pencil icon. This will open a new window placed over the element.
3.  The default threshold values are displayed at the bottom of this edit dashboard element window, below the section for chart type choice.
4.  In order to change the threshold limits, simply click inside the box and type.
5.  There are 4 limits to be set for each threshold, defining:
    *   The start of the interval for unsatisfactory performance (placed below the coloured bar).

    *   The end of the interval for unsatisfactory performance (placed above the coloured bar), which is also the start of the average performance interval.

    *   The end of the average performance interval (placed above the coloured bar), which is also the start of the high performance interval.

    *   The end of the high performance interval (placed below the coloured bar).

6.  There is an **Invert scale** button just above the threshold values bar, on the right side. This should be used for KPI or indicators for which high values represent unsatisfactory performance, and low values are desirable. An example of such an indicator can be indebtedness, for which a company might want to have the lowest amounts possible.
7.  The graphics of the element are refreshed instantly when the edit dashboard element window is closed, or when you click anywhere on the screen outside this window.

<details>
<summary>Import</summary>

This menu manages data imports from the connected data sources. Here you can start a new import of data, so that the data in the dashboards and elements is up to date. Just click the **Start import** button and check the progress bar that will appear to see the estimated duration of the data import operation.

When the operation has finished, you will see a short note containing the date, time and the result of the import below the **Start import** button, and which is also displayed at all times in the top right corner of the service window.

<details>
<summary>Mapping</summary>

This menu is available only to **Administrator** role users. Here you can map your accounts from financial accounting to the [BI Codes](https://github.com/alinbogdan/ContDocumentation/blob/master/translations/en/online-help/glossary.md) used for summarizing and standardizing the chart of accounts. The mapping is done one to one, for each account you select a BI Code to be assigned to it, from the available list.

Unmapped accounts will not be used in calculations, the amounts they contain will be ignored. For each unmapped account, the service will propose a BI Code to be assigned to it, but you need to confirm or change this proposal.

You can find out more about mapping accounts [here](https://github.com/alinbogdan/ContDocumentation/blob/master/translations/en/getting-started/mappings-task.md).

# Data import

There are nightly data imports scheduled and running automatically, retrieving relevant transactions from Visma.net Financials.

You can verify when the last import was processed from the text in the upper right part of the window. It should say "**Last complete import...**".

If you hover your mouse over the text, you will see the details of the last import and if import from some of the integrated sources failed. You can read more [here](https://github.com/alinbogdan/ContDocumentation/blob/master/translations/en/getting-started/check-erp-data-task.md) .

You can also do a manual import any time you want to accommodate the latest changes in Visma.net Financials, by going to the **Import** menu and clicking the **Start Import** button.

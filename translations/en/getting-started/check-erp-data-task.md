# How to check that your ERP data is integrated

Visma.net Insights is integrated with Visma.net ERP. Nightly data imports are scheduled and run automatically, but you can also do a manual import any time you want to refresh your data in the service.

1.  Verify that you received an email from **do.not.reply@visma.net** stating that you have access to the service for your company.
2.  When you log in to Visma.net Insights, your company's name appears in the top right corner, right under your user name (email address). Or if you have access to several companies check that you can find the company you need in the company selector:

    *   Place the mouse cursor over the top right corner where you see your user name (email address) and an arrow, and click.
    *   A selection window will appear.
    *   Under first item named "Select company" there is a drop-down list, click it.
    *   Find and select your chosen company from the list that unfolds.
    *   If you cannot find your company in the list, please contact support.

3.  Verify that data import was successful: under your user name (email address) and company name you will find a message with the status of the last import and the date / time when it was processed:
    *   If the message is "**Last updated mm/dd/yy hh:mm AM/PM**" than the data import was completed successfully. If you need to refresh the data start a manual import as described below. If despite that the import was successful you cannot see your data in the service, please contact support.
    *   If the message is "**Errors.ImportFailed Last updated mm/dd/yy hh:mm AM/PM**", then the last import could not be finalized. Please start a manual import as described below and check the message again. You can verify when the last import was processed and its status in the upper right product banner. Hovering over the field with your mouse, will show details from each of the different data sets being imported.
    *   You can make an import to refresh data in the service by going to the **Import** menu and clicking the **Start Import** button. Wait for the import process to finish and then check the message as described above.

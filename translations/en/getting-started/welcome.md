# Welcome

Welcome to the Getting Started help for Visma.net Insights! This service will provide you with online dashboards and charts prepared for using the data from your ERP system.

## Before you get started  

To start using the service, you first need to complete the following:

*   Verify that your ERP data is integrated, you can learn more [here](https://github.com/alinbogdan/ContDocumentation/blob/master/translations/en/getting-started/check-erp-data-task.md).
*   Map non-standard (or standard) accounts using our BI Codes mapping tool. This has to be done by a person with enhanced access rights (administrator role). You can learn more [here](https://github.com/alinbogdan/ContDocumentation/blob/master/translations/en/getting-started/mappings-task.md).

## Once this is done ...  

When opening Visma.net Insights, you will be directly led to the **Dashboards** page.

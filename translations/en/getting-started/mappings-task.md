# Mapping of accounts to BI Codes

In the **Settings** menu, you can review and change the mapping of your accounts from financial accounting to the [BI Codes](https://github.com/alinbogdan/ContDocumentation/blob/master/translations/en/online-help/glossary.md) used for summarizing and analysis. BI-codes are standardized account groups used for KPI calculation, which are necessary to standardize non-standard account charts. BI Codes accumulate several financial accounts based on common features they have like nature, function or content. The mapping of any account can be changed at any point in time.

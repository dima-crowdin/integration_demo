# Where is the newly added dashboard element?

A newly added element will be placed on the first free spot on the dashboard.

If it is in a new dashboard it will be placed right on the top of it.

If the dashboard already has elements the newly added one will be placed after the other elements, or on a free spot in between the other elements. Sometimes you need to scroll down to see it.

# Active contract customers-period end

## Represents

The number of customers that have at least one contract active at the end of each of the selected time periods.

## Interpretation

With _Active_, we mean customers that are continuing the contract the next period. To be counted, the customers must have at least one contract with an activation date this period or earlier, and the expiration date must not be at the end of the period. A contract that is cancelled or expiring at the end of one period is not counted even if it was active during the period

This indicator is a quantitative measure. An increase in the indicator value from one period to the next means that during that time interval the company gained customers. A decrease indicates that customers were lost.

# Active customer contracts-period end

## Represents

The number of contracts that are active at the end of each of the selected time periods.

## Interpretation

With _Active_, we mean contracts that are continuing the next period. To be counted, the contracts must have an activation date this period or earlier, and the expiration date must not be at the end of the period. A contract that is cancelled or expiring at the end of one period is not counted even if it was active during the period.
